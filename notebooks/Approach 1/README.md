    This was an initial trial using ChatGPT, which involved several - 9+ prompts to arrive at a python code to generate the desired table in the format as expected. - check prompts.ipynb

# Pros

    Good to see ChatGPT interpret your queries correctly
    More control at every step
    Verbose

# Cons
    Incorrect Results - Seems to Hallucinate Plan Name with First Name
    Too Many Prompts
    Not scalable if trying to build something more generic
    The entire table was entered - which is bad for privacy
